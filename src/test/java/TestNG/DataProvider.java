//In TestNG, a data provider is a mechanism that allows you to provide test data to a test method.
//It enables you to run the same test method with different sets of data, making it easier to perform data-driven testing.
//The data provider is annotated with @DataProvider, and the method annotated with @Test can consume this data by specifying the data
//provider's name in the dataProvider attribute.
